# Building a Minimal Blog with SvelteKit 5

Creating a blog in 2025 means focusing on performance, simplicity, and developer experience. Here's how I built this minimal blog using the latest web technologies.

## The Tech Stack

- **SvelteKit 5**: The latest version with runes for reactive state
- **Markdown**: Simple content creation with frontmatter
- **Static Generation**: Pre-rendered pages for lightning-fast loading
- **Modern CSS**: Blur effects and gradient backgrounds

## Key Features

### âš¡ Static Generation
Every page is pre-rendered at build time, ensuring maximum performance and SEO benefits.

### ðŸŽ¨ Modern Design
Clean typography with a modern blur aesthetic using CSS backdrop filters and gradients.

### ðŸ“± Responsive
Works beautifully on all screen sizes with a mobile-first approach.

### ðŸš€ Fast
No JavaScript sent to the client for content pages - pure HTML and CSS.

## Code Highlights

The blog uses SvelteKit's file-based routing and server-side data loading to transform markdown files into static HTML pages at build time.

This approach gives us the best of both worlds: a great developer experience with markdown, and optimal user experience with static HTML.
