# Hello World

Welcome to my minimal blog! I'm excited to share my thoughts on web development, technology, and creative projects.

## Why I Started This Blog

I wanted to create a simple, fast, and beautiful place to share my ideas. This blog is built with:

- **SvelteKit 5** with the new runes system
- **Static generation** for maximum performance
- **Markdown** for easy content creation
- **Modern design** with a blur aesthetic

## What's Next?

I'll be writing about:

- Web development best practices
- Creative coding projects
- Technology insights
- Personal reflections

Stay tuned for more content!
